    <dt><strong><b>What is a yurt?</dt></strong></b>
    <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanance structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is
      fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be
      opened.</dd>
      <dt><strong><b>How are the yurts furnished?</dt></strong></b>
        <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
          Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
          running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
          <dt><strong><b>What should I bring?</dt></strong></b>
          <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing
            weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense
            of adventure!</dd><br>
